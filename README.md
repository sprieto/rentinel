High inflation, pricing volatility, lack of transparency, and many other issues tenants and landlords face provide an opportunity for smart contracts to help regulate an outdated business. Our smart contract facilitates the automation of the ongoing transaction between the involved parties, as well as providing a secure deposit held by a wallet assigned to the contract, which could be placed into staking to generate additional yields. Our solution facilities the dispute process in case a breach of agreement occurs.
The deposit, in most cases, cannot be monitored by the tenant after it is given to the landlord. In addition, the Deposit deductions are usually done arbitrarily by one of the parties, without an efficient or cost-effective means to dispute. By using an escrow smart contract, the risk of fraud can be reduced by ensuring proper escrow logic execution, along with the transparency of having the transaction accessible to all participants through an open distributed ledger or blockchain.
